types of formal grammars:
linear, context-free, context, general

Empty word = epsilon (ε) = 0
*especially in this course, (some other ppl might use λ)

Basic:
(xy)z = x(yz)
x^n+1 = x^n*x = x*x^n

palindrome:
x = bob
rev(bob) = x
x^2 = bobbob
#_b(x) = 2; letter b in word(x)

neutral (ε):
xε = εx = x
changes nothing
x^0 = ε

prefix, suffix:
ε = both prefix&suffix
whole word != its proper prefix/suffix
prefix/suffix ∈ proper prefix/suffix 

language:
complement of a set is things that do not belong to a set
A consists of alphabets {a,b,c}
notA = all that does not belong to A but can be constructed from A's alphabet
ε
concatenation of lang:
A = {w}
B = {v}
AB = {x=wv, w in A & v in B} (all possible concatenated words from both languages), (note that something may repeat which does not count additionally towards the set)
{ab,aa}* = {ε,ab,aa,abab,abaa,aaab,....}
language could be: set of ∅, Sum*, {x in {a,b}* : |x| = 42}
A^0 = {ε}
A = {a,b}, A^2 = {aa,ab,ba,bb}
Σ*, Σ = {a,b} 

Kleene's star:
A* = A^0 v A^1 v A^2 v ... (0 or more),(everything from A by repeating as many times of A as possible)
e.g. A = {a,b}, A* = {ε, a,b, aa,ab,ba,bb, ...}
A+ = A* - A^0 = A v A^2 v A^3 v ... (1 or more) 

∅ = empty language
{ε} = language contains empty word (neutral element of concatenation of words)
complement of A = U - A (complement of a set, is things that do not belong to a set)
A∅ = ∅ (because it has nothing to combine)

a v (b & c)
